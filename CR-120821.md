# Code Review - 11/08/21 - @octowl

## `.gitignore`

Please. Please please. Gitignore your `media/` directory.

## Routing Conventions

Consider using a more conventional REST API design for your routes:

`GET` `/users` - get all users
`GET` `/users/:id` - get a user

`GET` `/categories` - get all categories
`POST` `/categories` - create a new category

`GET` `/auctions` - get all auctions
`POST` `/auctions` - create a new auction
`PUT` `/auctions/:id` - update an auction
`DELETE` `/auctions/:id` - delete an auction

## Security

All routes are currently public. Consider securing them and requiring authentication soon.
